## **Introduction**

It is self-evident proof that cloud computing is advancing both in importance and popularity.With the increasing demand for cloud services, the adoption rate is also expanding and it is becoming a key driving force for businesses as applications are moved out in a bid to innovate, avoid undesirable costs, and increase agility.

Cloud computing has come a long way ever since it was discovered. Now, it is no longer a question for businesses whether they should switch to cloud computing or not, but now they are confused about choosing the right cloud computing platform to opt for. Currently, we know that the cloud computing market is saturated with numerous cloud service providers, but AWS, Azure, and Google [Cloud Platform are the top three slots](https://www.tatvasoft.com/outsourcing/2021/12/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-platform.html) gaining immense popularity in the market.

All these platforms have several common features such as identity management, instant provisioning, self-service, autoscaling, security, and compliance, among others. But currently, AWS is considered one of the best cloud platforms as compared to Azure and GCP in terms of maturity and functionality. Because the richness and benefits of AWS lambda allow your application to deliver desired outcomes with the option of Pay as you use and perform everything from coding, configuring, deploying, and taking all required measures to make the application beneficial for the business. They overpower the public cloud landscape by offering the most secure, flexible, and reliable cloud services.Their respective cloud platforms provide a range of computing, networking, and storage options.

It might be a tough task for you to choose the right cloud platform because there are many serverless offerings available in the market. So to ease your task, we're here to discuss the best cloud platform for enterprises in detail and help you choose the right one depending on your requirements. So without any further ado, let's get started!

## **Overview of cloud computing**

As we all know, the traditional way to host applications was complicated and expensive. The amount of software and hardware resources required to run those applications are complex. So you might need a dedicated and professional team of developers to install, test, run, update, and secure them.

The demand for Cloud computing is continuously increasing and it requires computer resources like servers: containing Memory, and CPU. Various types of storage space: object storage, and blob storage. Networking: connecting with the premise, virtual networks, subnets, etc, and Databases like structured data, unstructured data, and semi-structured data. But the good thing about using these cloud computing services is; that you only pay for what you use.

Let us discuss the best types of cloud computing services in detail before we proceed further:

### **Amazon Web Services**

Amazon Web Services is one of the most widely used and popular cloud platforms that provides on-demand cloud computing services to businesses, government organizations, and individuals on a paid subscription basis. You can select a web application platform, operating system, database, programming language, and other required services depending on your requirements. You'll have a virtual environment that will allow you to load the software and services that your software needs.

AWS has more features and services than any other cloud providerâ€“from infrastructure technologies like databases-to emerging technologies, computing, and storage, such as the Internet of Things, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. It offers customizable and cost-effective solutions for small businesses and provides all the required tools to grow your business from the ground up.

### **Microsoft Azure**

Microsoft Azure is a close competition to AWS with an exceptionally capable cloud infrastructure. Azure enables easy mobility and provides a reliable platform between the public and on-premise cloud. It has a variety of hybrid connections including content delivery networks, virtual private networks, and caches to enhance performance and usability.

As compared to other cloud services, Azure has more data centers and delivery points that allow you to deliver content faster and offer an optimal user experience. Here you can store all types of data in a reliable and secure environment as well as you can also share it across VMs. In short, Azure is a service developed to help businesses achieve their objectives and overcome any complex challenge that comes on their way. It is a fully flexible IT solution and provides you the freedom to develop, manage, and deploy applications using a global network and on a consumption basis.

### **Google Cloud Platform**

Google cloud platform makes sure that it provides the highest service availability level among the most popular cloud service providers. It offers highly scalable and reliable GCP services to users that help them compute and store data, and help software developers to create, test, run, and deploy applications.

The technical expertise of GCP is profound and its industry-leading tools require deep learning and machine learning, data analytics, and artificial intelligence are its significant benefits. GCP is different from [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and AWS as its backbone network is made up of miles of fiber optic cables. They use more advanced network technologies and provide top-notch services to deliver fast and scalable outcomes.

## **Comparing Serverless Architecture Providers: AWS, Azure, and Google**

### **1. Service Integration**

Service integration is a system of tools and technologies that are used to combine a variety of applications, systems, and repositories, and allows you to exchange or transfer data and processes in real-time.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS allows its users to integrate services easily such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Beanstalk, and much more. | With Azure, you can integrate services like Azure app service, Azure VM, SQL databases, etc | It allows users to integrate services such as Cloud SQL, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, etc. |

### **2.Concurrency**

When a request is processed in these cloud services by a FaaS model and another request is acquired, a new instance is spun up to process this request but all the requests cannot be processed simultaneously, it only processes one at a time. Concurrency is the number of simultaneous functions that can run at any given time.

| **Services**                  | **Concurrency**                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Lambda**                | Standard: 1000 per region (soft limit)Reserved: variesProvisioned: varies |
| **Microsoft Azure functions** | No advertised concurrency limit                                           |
| **GCP cloud functions**       | No advertised concurrency limit                                           |

### **3.Pricing**

The major cloud service provider has a monthly free quota that allows users to use services for free for one month and after reaching the quota, the cost is incurred. So if you are testing or making a proof-of-concept, you are most likely to complete this before the free tier quota expires. Now, let us see what each of these cloud providers offers in the free tier quota and how much additional usage expenses are required.

## **Key Takeaway**

So that's it for the post. Here we have mentioned enough about the major cloud providers that can help you to choose the right platform for your business. When we compare the FaaS offerings of the three cloud providers, there is one very obvious thing: they are similar and comparable in terms of cost and features. We can say that AWS Lambda is mature and one of the most popular of the three cloud providers. Azure functions appear to have many similar features and a variety of options to accommodate edge cases. Whereas [Google cloud platform functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) have fewer bells but it can be comparable to the other two.

Almost all the serverless cloud providers offer the same features, and functionalities, and have the same capabilities with limited feature differentiation. But choosing the right cloud platform that suits your business requirements is one of the best ways to achieve success.
